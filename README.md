# Mission to Mars

## Project Overview

Robin is looking for ways to improve the functionality of her Mars app. Although it is complete as it is, she would like to add images of all Mars's hemispheres and make it overall more attractive. 
In order to do so, we will use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape updated images and store the data on mongo, and display it all in the web app using Flask.

## Resources
- Software:
  - Python
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - MongoDB

## Ressults
As a final result, we got a Flask web application that included images, a dataframe turned into a table and a description of the latest articles published in NASA's webpage.
